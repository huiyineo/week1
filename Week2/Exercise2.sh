# Exercise 2.1:
Write a script with two methods. 
The first method should read in a matrix like the one here and return a list of lists. 
The first method should take the file name as a parameter. 

def 

The second method should do the inverse, namely take, as input, a list of lists and save it in a file with same format as the initial file. 
The second method should take two arguments, the list of lists, and a filename of where to save the output.

# Exercise 2.2:

# Write a script that takes an integer N, and outputs all bit-strings of length N as lists. For example: 3 -> [0,0,0], [0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]. As a sanity check, remember that there are 2^N such lists.

# Do not use the bin-function in Python. Do not use strings at all. Do not import anything. Try to solve this using only lists, integers, if-statements, loops and functions.

# Exercise 2.3:

# Write a script that takes this file (from this Kaggle competition), extracts the request_text field from each dictionary in the list, and construct a bag of words representation of the string (string to count-list).

# There should be one row pr. text. The matrix should be N x M where N is the number of texts and M is the number of distinct words in all the texts.

# The result should be a list of lists ([[0,1,0],[1,0,0]] is a matrix with two rows and three columns).
